[Question 1] The accelerometer/magnetometer comes pre-wired on the STM board. Open up the
Accelerometer/Magnetometer Data Sheet and find the page with the Pin Descriptions. How many pins
does it have? List the pins and their names. Next find the electrical specifications under the Electrical
Characteristics section. How many volts (Vdd) are required to power the accelerometer/magnetometer?
The accelerometer/magnetometer is sitting somewhere on the STM board. Try to find it and describe
where it is.

Pin# Name     Function
1    Vdd_     IO Power supply for I/O pins
2    SCL 	  Signal interface I 2 C serial clock (SCL)
3    SDA      Signal interface I 2 C serial data (SDA)
4    INT2     Inertial Interrupt 2
5    INT1     Inertial Interrupt 1
6    C1       Reserved capacitor connection (C1)
7 	 GND      0 V supply
8    Reserved Leave unconnected
9    DRDY     Data ready
10   Reserved Connect to GND
11   Reserved Connect to GND
12   SETP S/R capacitor connection (C2)
13   SETC S/R capacitor connection (C2)
14   Vdd      Power supply


-Vdd Supply voltage 2.16 3.6 V
-The accelerometer/magnetometer is located right side top corner of the board, i.e., above 5V pin.

[Question 2] Why do we write to the accelerometer/magnetometer before we can read from them? What are the following lines of code doing? Hint: Look at the comments.
-The I2C Master writing the address of the slave to select from which peripheral it has to read the data from continuosly.

[Question 3] What do the following lines of code do? (It is only necessary to explain the accelerometer)
-It is adding two consecutive bytes from the buffer each time and it is converting that data in to float to get the accelometer data.

Difficulties and What did you learn
-I got difficulty in figuring out the compass data values because the data it reads so fastly.
